# googlebusinessscrape
This program will scrape the Google Places API near you and return business name, address, and phone number in an easy to read .csv file that can be used for importing up to 60 records at a time, depending on total results. Businesses with more than one location will be removed from the list to avoid duplicate records, recording the address and phone information for only the first listing.
